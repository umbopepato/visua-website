  <h3>Motivation</h3>
  <p>Once you have created your company's identity you want to iterate those concepts to all of your products (being
    them websites, apps, marketing material, document templates...) but there is a moment in which that data is
    translated <i>manually</i> by developers, marketers and designers. Visua wants to remove that manual intervention
    by letting you code that information into a set of files and use that for your builds</p>
